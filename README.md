# pspassword
Script was written to streamline helpdesk password reset.

I wrote this script to help streamline our Help Desks password reset ability. 
I found that needing to keep AD open all the time and its semi clunky way of doing password resets and account unlocks to be tedious.

After I had the basics I also realized that I needed to make this one click and go to an extent. So I added parts to make sure things stayed up to date and lanuched the whole script as an admin. This was my first dive into hooking PS into AD and it took a couple of tries to get it right. It is simple but I am happy with the results.
